# ANLY 512 Statistical Learning for ANLY

This course is concerned with the statistical theory and with algorithms to find structure for supervised and unsupervised learning. A well-known method for supervised learning is linear regression, and this will be covered early in the course. Statistical methods for making discrete predictions (classification) such as logistic regression will also be covered. Special emphasis will be placed on techniques for handling high-dimensional data (i.e. instances with many attributes), including variable selection and dimension reduction. The course will also cover ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting that are often used to improve the results of given classification methods. Unsupervised methods covered in this course include model-based and hierarchical clustering. The course will use statistical software (**R**) throughout.
